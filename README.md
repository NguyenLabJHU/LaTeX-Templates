# LaTeX-Templates

This is a collection of personal LaTeX templates (article, large report, and beamer presentation for Johns Hopkins) for academic purposes. The collection contains a few directories (descriptions are given below). Users are welcome to clone/ fork/ download these templates. The templates were generated on Overleaf and compiled with the `pdflatex` compiler. I highly recommend using the templates in Overleaf (see below).

> [!TIP]
> If you are new to using LaTeX, these templates may be a bit overwhelming to you. I highly suggest going through the main files of the repository you are interested in before using them. Each template subdirectory includes a separate README file that describes the details of the template. Additionally, I generously commented on different sections of the scripts.

> [!WARNING]
> I do not use the beamer template regularly except for a few occasions. This is a very primitive template but I intend to update it soon. I also have not added the `README` file for this template yet. Hopefully, it will be there soon :pray:! 


## Compiling on Overleaf

Currently, all my regular LaTeX templates are contained in this repository. Even if you are interested in one particular subdirectory, you may have to clone or download the whole repository (sorry about that). I just found it inefficient to manage multiple repositories for similar projects. I personally highly recommend using [Overleaf](https://www.overleaf.com) for these projects. You can also do it locally on your computer. In that case, you may have to install a proper text editor and latex compiler based on your system. However, I am assuming, you already have a tex system configured (local or Overleaf) when you're using these templates (either on Overleaf or locally). Follow the following instructions

- Clone the repository to a specific location on your local computer. Alternatively, you can download the .zip file for this project.
- Once downloaded, unzip (if you downloaded) and navigate to the specific subdirectory of the template that you need or are interested in.
- Compress the specific subdirectory you are interested in. Head to Overleaf. Click on New Project > Upload Project and then upload the subdirectory you compressed before.
- Alternatively, you can create a project on Overleaf and upload the files or subfolders directly to the project you created.
- Your project should be ready now. You can rename the project and start working on it. Compile the main file using the `pdflatex` compiler on Overleaf. It should generate the PDF on the Overleaf PDF viewer without any error (if there's any warning, you can perhaps ignore them).
