\begin{frame}{Highlighting text}
    
    In this slide, some important text will be \alert{highlighted} with JHU color because it's important. Please, don't \alert{abuse} it.
    
    \begin{block}{Remark}
        Sample text
    \end{block}
    
    \begin{alertblock}{Important theorem}
        Sample text in the red box
    \end{alertblock}
    
    \begin{examples}
        Sample text in the green box. The title of the block is ``Examples''.

    \textbf{Enumerate environment with classic colors}
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Hello, this is the \RED{first} point
        %
        \item This is my \GREEN{second} point

    \vspace{0.5in}
    
    \textbf{Itemize environment with JHU colors}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item This is a separate \BLUE{itemize} test 
        %
        \item Second point for the \PURPLE{separate} test

\section{Second project}
\subsection{Testing math environment}
\begin{frame}{Integration}
    Integration is also known as anti-derivative which represents the area under the curve. For indefinite integral, we should add a constant $C$ to the anti-derivative expressions.
    \begin{equation*}
        \int \exp(x) \ dx = \exp(x) + C
    \end{equation*}
    
    You can \textbf{\BLUE{boldface colors}} to emphasize even more\footnote{Hyperlinks will appear as \url{https://overleaf.com}}.
